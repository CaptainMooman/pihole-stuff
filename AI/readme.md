Some "AI" blocklists in here.
I think AI is fine sometimes, but a lot of times it is a nightmare.

This is inspired by https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist/tree/main, and someone who was asking for all the URLs and other stuff for pi-hole blocklisting.

You'll find some lists with details in the comments within.
