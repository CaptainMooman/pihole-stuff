#### [The SNAFU Blocklist](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/pihole-stuff/blob/master/SNAFU.txt):
An ever-evolving blocklist of ads, analytics, tracker, and other domains. Artisinally crafted - attempting to find and include "new" domains that have yet to be added in the default Ublock Origin list(s) or in other popular hosted blocklists.

#### Python Scripts
A few poorly cobbled together `.py` scripts to find possible URLs to add to the blocklist.
