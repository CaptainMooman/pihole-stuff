### [The SNAFU Blocklist](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/pihole-stuff/blob/master/SNAFU.txt):
An ever-evolving blocklist of ads, analytics, tracker, and other domains. Artisinally crafted - attempting to find and include "new" domains that have yet to be added in the default Ublock Origin list(s) or in other popular hosted blocklists.

Add the following link to your pi-hole adlists management config or other blocklist setup: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RooneyMcNibNug/pihole-stuff/master/SNAFU.txt

If you run into a problem loading critical elements of a page due to a domain being included within this blocklist, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/pihole-stuff/issues) and I will tend to it as soon as possible. 

### [Latest "Marketing Technology Landscape" Mosaic](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/pihole-stuff/blob/master/martech5000k2020Apr.jpg)
One of the more painful illustrations conveying just how massive the user-targeting industry has become. At least it helps with discovering new domains to enumerate for the blocklist.

### [Adlists I use](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/pihole-stuff/blob/master/adlists_config.txt)
A compilation of lists I use within different environments, sorted by "type".

### Python Scripts
A few poorly cobbled together `.py` scripts to find possible URLs to add to the blocklist.
